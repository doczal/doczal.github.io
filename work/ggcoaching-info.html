<p>GG Coaching is a site I put together for practice. I thought it'd be fun to make a site about video game coaching.</p>
<p>I worked on this site with 3 goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Familiarize myself with Sass.</li>
  <li>Learn to use a task runner (Grunt, in this case).</li>
  <li>Use jQuery.</li>
</ul>
