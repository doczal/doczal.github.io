<p>I had already created a personal website some time ago. It looked a bit plain, so I decided to give it a facelift.</p>
<p>If you couldn't already tell, I'm an avid gamer. The original Game Boy played a big part in getting me into video games, so I decided to use it as the basis of my site's theme.</p>
<p>I modeled the site header after the Game Boy console itself, and each project is contained within a Game Boy cartridge. I also thought it'd be fun to make use of the console's green-ish 4 color palette.</p>
<p>This was a good opportunity for me to learn a new thing or two, so I chose to use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator, for this project. I also used Gulp to help out with stuff like minification and auto-prefixing.</p>
<p>Setting up Jekyll to work correctly with Gulp was quite the undertaking, as I constantly struggled with bugs and issues before I could even begin coding the site itself. Fortunately, it was worth it in the end, as it immensely sped up my workflow.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to host this site, which also happens to support Jekyll. Pretty neat!</p>
