<p>South West Allied Therapies is a team of health specialists based in Western Australia. They provide services such as speech and occupational therapy. They are mobile, and often travel to deliver their service to clients.</p>
<p>They had just set up their business at the time, so they required both a company logo as well as a website.</p>
<p>I decided to use Wordpress to build their site, mainly to force myself to learn Wordpress. I started out with a basic <a href="https://themekraft.com/tk-wordpress-bootstrap-starter-theme/">Bootstrap theme</a>, and customized the site from there.</p>
